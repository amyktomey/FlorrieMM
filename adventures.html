  <h4 > Florrie's first faire adventure was in Ashville, Ohio, at their annual Viking Festival.</h4>
    It was her first time setting up at a festival on her own. The weekend started a little rough. We were not prepared for wind gusts 
    that damaged our tent. After we realized that the tent needed to come down, the fine folks that ran the festival sent six mighty warriors to help us put away our damaged tent and move us into the pavilion, where we were able to set up shop and finish the weekend in style... under a solid roof!
    <br>
    <br>
    Now that she could set up shop in a safer location, Sunday dawned with great promise. Many folks that had passed through on Saturday sought us out.  Every single larger potion was gone before noon.  Much interest was shown in the DIY potion kits that are scheduled to hit Shopify later this month. She has planning on adding some new potions for the Highland Renaissance Fair in Emenince, KY.  You can get a sneak peek on her TicTok.

    I (Florrie's Mom) spent the weekend as a story collector... bartering for stories, jokes, dances and a wide variety of small items. I learned some new knock knock jokes and witnessed the latest new dances.  One young man showed me his finest pitch, and many others drew me pictures that are stored in my special treasure box.
    <br>
    Florrie is so appreciative of the outpouring of support that she has decided to make the Viking Festival an annual event too!</p>
