       <h3>2024 was a busy year for Florrie's Magical Misfits.</h3>

       Starting with the Viking Festival in Ashand Ohio, she had her fist experience with big winds.  We had a wonderful time, made a lot of friends and are planning to go back this year.
       <br>  
       Florrie spent 8 amazing weekends at the Renaissance Fair in Emenince, KY.  Our application has been submitted, and we are eagerly awaiting the results..
       <br>
       We found a faire in Hopkinsville KY.  The first ever SCRIBE and SCOUT Rennaissence Faire was on September28, 2024.  It rained that day, so the event was moved into the library.  The rain didn't matter, as folks came in droves to step into history.  Just one day, but it was amazing for everyone involved. 
       <br>

       <h5>YouTube Live Streams</h5>
       Because of the TicTok ban, Florrie will be streaming from YouTube in the future.
       Look for YouTube Live Streams popping up on weekday evenings and Saturday mornings unless she's at an event. <br>The instructional video for her DIY potion kits is available now on YouTube.
