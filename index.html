       2024 was a busy year for Florrie's Magical Misfits.
       <br>
       Starting with the Viking Festival in Ashand Ohio, she had her fist experience with big winds.  We had a wonderful time, made a lot of friends and are planning to go back this year.
       <br>  
       Florrie spent 8 amazing weekends at the Renaissance Fair in Emenince, KY.  Our application for that one is going in before the end of the month.
       <br>
       We found a faire in Hopkinsville KY.  The first ever SCRIBE and SCOUT Rennaissence Faire was on September28, 2024.  It rained that day, so the event was moved into the library.  The rain didn't matter, folks came in droves to step into history.  Just one day, but it was amazing for everyone involved.
