      </ul>
      All kits include: one bottle of Florrie's special potion water, charm and bead for decoration, mini scoop for mica powder, glue gun for wax, handle for stamp, E600 to seal bottle lid... all in a handy storage box. **Please do not store the glue gun when it is hot.**
      <br>Everything you need to create your one-of-a-kind potion at home EXCEPT scissors and paper towel.
      <br> Please watch the tutorial completely before assembling your potion.  If you need to rinse out your bottle, use rubbing alcohol.  Do not add tap water to Florrie's special formula. Her blend comes with mold deterrent, and is specially formulated to make the best potion.
      <br> Remember, these potions are NOT for drinking.
